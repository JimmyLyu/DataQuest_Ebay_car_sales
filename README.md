In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user *orgesleka*.
DataQeust has made the following modification on the original data:

sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure code runs quicker
dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what one would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)
The data dictionary provided with data is as follows:




The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.
